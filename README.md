## About

This project investigates a method for automatically generating podcast audio summaries. This project is a web application that concentrates on extractive summaries, which are created by selecting a collection of pertinent audio parts from a podcast without changing or altering the original material. Before listening to the full episode, such summaries would educate the viewer about the podcast's subjects. The project should point out that the goal is not to offer the viewer a shortened version of the entire show, but rather to give an overview in the style of a film teaser
